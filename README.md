# MITSUI-CO. Commodity Prediction Challenge

This repository contains my work for the Mitsui Commodity Prediction Challenge on Kaggle.
The challenge is to build models that predict future commodity returns using historical data from the London Metal Exchange (LME), Japan Exchange Group (JPX), US equities, and Forex markets. 
The task requires extracting signals from these heterogeneous datasets to generate stable, long-horizon forecasts ‚Äî a core problem in systematic trading strategy design and global risk management.

üöÄ Approach

1. Data Preprocessing and EDA
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Inference (Submission Notebook)


üîë Key Files

commodity_prediction.py : Main training pipeline. Performs preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, Optuna hyperparameter search, model training, CV evaluation, and saving artifacts.

submission_notebook.py : Deployment notebook for Kaggle evaluation. Loads saved models and feature list, defines the predict function, and runs the Mitsui inference server.

models (pkl files) & top_features.json : Contains trained model artifacts and metadata generated by commodity_prediction.py.

üìä Results

* Achieved Public LB RMSE: 1.236 with LightGBM models.

üîÆ Potential Future Improvements

* Multi-target models: Instead of one model per target, explore multi-output regression (e.g., LightGBM multi-output, CatBoost multi-RMSE).

* Ensemble methods: Blend ARIMA/LSTM with LightGBM predictions.

* Feature importance filtering: Use SHAP values to refine feature set beyond correlation.

* Deep learning: Temporal models (Temporal Fusion Transformer, TFT) or Seq2Seq for multi-step prediction.

* Cross-instrument structure: Incorporate correlation networks between instruments as graph features.

* Market regimes: Regime detection (volatility clusters, structural breaks) to condition models.
  
üè¶ About

This project fits into my broader interest in quantitative finance and systematic trading strategies:

- Emphasis on feature engineering from financial time series.

- Application of machine learning with time series cross-validation.

- Exploration of multi-asset predictive structures relevant to portfolio management and risk modeling.
